# Classic pong game built with JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.

**Goal:**<br> 
Use your paddle to hit the ball past your opponent.

**Key Activities:**<br> 
I use JavaScript and HTML 5 canvas to recreate a classic pong game. The coolest part was writing code that created a simple form of artificial intelligence in which the computer operates the right-side paddle on its own. In other words, the right paddle's vertical position would adjust based on the ball's vertical position. The higher the ball moved, the higher the right-side paddle would move on its own- based on the code written. Nice! It was also fun to continue to learn the concept of game "collisions," which is when 2 or more objects intersect on the game screen. (e.g. the ball bounces off a paddle when the two items "collide") This is a cental tenet in game design and holds broader lessons for web devlopment.

**JavaScript Elements Used**

- boolean values
- Event Listeners (detect when player moves mouse)
- Variable Scope: Global/local variables
- const var (CONSTANT variables remain unchanged throughout the program)
- setInterval (controls animation refresh rates)
- getBoundingClientRect()  (Returns the size of an element and position relative to the viewport.)

**Gaming Concepts**<br>

- checking for collisions on board (e.g. paddle hits ball or ball bounces off wall)
- reversing direction (ball changes direction when hit)
- ball speed travels fastest when hit by paddle's edges. this encourages players to increase risk by trying to strike the ball with the paddle's edges.
- game boundaries (the ball has to stay in play)
- scoring (track scores and performance)
- Game Over (game ends when a player scores 3 goals)

Enjoy!<br>
